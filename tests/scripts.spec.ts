Playwright test scripts were generated for the 'demo-angular' application covering all required scenarios:
- SCRUM-10: Navigating via secondary menu item routes correctly
- SCRUM-9: Navigating via primary menu item routes correctly and sets active state
- SCRUM-8: Switching between breakpoints recalculates the layout
- SCRUM-7: Menu behaves as overlay on small screens
- SCRUM-6: Split-pane shows persistent menu on large screens
Scripts are ready for transfer and repository integration.
